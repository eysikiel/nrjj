				ILOILO CITY, Philippine — On August 19, classes officially kicked off at West Visayas State University. 
				Lyka Lamparero, a freshman BSIT student, shared that she is still in 
				the adjustment phase after a month of classes.
			</p>

			<p>
				After a month in a course that doesn’t align with her existing skills, 
				Lamparero admitted she is struggling to adjust, especially with major subjects. 
				She has also started to feel anxious about whether the course she chose is the right fit for her.
			</p>

			<p>
				"I feel an overwhelming amount of pressure, especially during laboratory activities. 
				The programs I work on take me days to complete, while my classmates finish theirs in an hour or less. 
				I often find myself questioning if I really belong here," Lamparero said in a statement last Monday.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, despite her concerns, she is doing her best to learn and keep pace with her classmates, 
				putting in double the effort in hopes of achieving better results and mastering coding activities.
			</p>

			<p>		
				"I just received my first failed programming lab activity last week. 
				Sure, it bothers me, but it also strengthens my drive to keep going. 
				I believe in the saying that if you're struggling, then you're on the right path," she added.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the challenges in adjusting, she shared that she found a sense of fullfilment and enjoyment
				everytime she managed to build and debug a program. Lamparero is now studying in advance for the upcoming midterms exam.
