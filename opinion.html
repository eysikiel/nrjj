				<b>'Walang pera sa course na 'yan'</b>
			<p/>

			<p>
				<i> by Lyka Lamparero, BSIT student </i>
			</p>

			<p>
				When she was a kid, it wasn't gadgets or mobile phones that she held; it was always a book. 
				A storybook, to be specific, one that had been worn out by her cousins, 
				with pages so fragile that even a slight movement could tear them from the binding. 
				Yet, she didn’t care. The content mattered more to her than the condition of the book. 
				She was happy reading fiction stories, some of which she had heard verbally, and others that were new to her ears.
			</p>

			<p>
				Her love for stories led her to enroll in the Special Program in the Arts, majoring in Creative Writing. 
				This passion pushed her to become not just a reader but a writer as well. 
				It began with poems and evolved into short fiction—a genre that may be light, or perhaps not, 
				but definitely not too sensitive for readers to draw lessons from.
			</p>

			<p>
				As she moved on to Senior High School, she realized that writing is not just all about rainbows; 
				it is a powerful tool that can either glorify or slander someone, a means to impart knowledge to many, 
				and a way to influence people's beliefs. This is not just your typical writing; this is journalism.
			</p>

			<p>
				She instantly fell in love with journalism. Her writing makes her feel free; 
				her voice of opinion grows stronger when it comes to column writing, her critical assessment skills improve in editorial writing, 
				and her storytelling skills are applied in news writing—her niche. She never expected that she could love writing even more. 
				It's no surprise that the idea of pursuing a course aligned with journalism and her passion entered her mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Surprisingly, however, she is now writing this piece while mindfully inserting HTML tags in every line, 
				visualizing how her webpage will look. Yes, she is now a first-year college student, majoring in BSIT. 
				Unfortunately, the course she wanted to pursue was deemed impractical by her parents, 
				who advised her to choose a path where she could easily find a job and earn a good income. 
				“walang pera d'yan!" they said. 
				This is her story—a girl learning to embrace the program she chose while doing her best to keep her passion alive.
